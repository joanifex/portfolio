The AsylumConnect catalog currently helps LGBTQ asylum seekers find safe resources during the U.S. asylum process. LGBTQ asylum seekers can use our free resource website and app to meet their needs in: housing, legal, food, medical, mental health, social support, employment, education, and more. Nonprofits and lawyers can also use our catalog to find safe resource referrals for LGBTQ clients.

I volunteered on this project as an Associate Web Developer from the application's start to its launch. I was able to contribute about 10+ hours / week for approximately 3 months. 
* Built 20+ reusable components for handling common application states, such as error messages and dialogs
* Coordinated with organization leadership in order to implement wireframes and specs established by UX designer and team lead
* Wrote library for API requests to One Degree for use throughout the application by other developers on the project team
* Architected client-side authentication and session management using JWT
