Instructure is an educational technology company building LMS software for education and businesses.

As a software engineer I built a new product for creating employee engagement surveys and measuring employee engagement. I worked on:

- Integrating a micro frontend application in existing product platform with webpack ops
- Working with design and product teams to create a brand new minimum viable product for market
- Creating 30+ reusable React components, establishing product architecture and ensuring consistency and performance
- Partnering with backend engineers to design and build REST APIs in Java Spring
