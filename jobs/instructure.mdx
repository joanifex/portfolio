Instructure is an educational technology company building LMS software for education and businesses.

I worked on a new product for the Bridge platform for measuring employee engagement through data analysis and employee surveys. 

### Some Tech I Learned 

##### [D3](https://d3js.org) data-visualization library
D3 makes me feel like a wizard, and that's pretty cool. Special thanks to [Shirley Wu](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/d3-js-react/) because I was totally lost.

##### [WAI-ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/WAI-ARIA_basics)
I knew the basics of a11y, but creating custom components that passed accessibility audits was an eye-opener and changed my entire development process.

##### [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org) dev enviroment for building UI components
Storybook makes my life better. I can work for days without ever opening up the application? Yes, please. 

##### [Flow](https://flow.org) a static typechecker for JavaScript
Initially, I don't think I fully grased how useful a typechecker is. I was so naive.

##### [Jest](https://jestjs.io) & [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/) test runner and testing utility for React
Writing good tests for UI components is difficult. After much practice, I can proudly say that my tests pass the coverage report and please don't ask any follow up questions. 

##### [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) client-side schema validator
I used to think form validation was hard. Turns out, when you are validating against an explicit schema, it's slightly easier and my headache was slightly less excruciating.

##### [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) so very good?
I'd used SVG before, but never really dug into the internals until I had to figure out to dynamically nest an SVG inside another SVG inside of a responsive component.
