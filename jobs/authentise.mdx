Authentise is a tech start up building software for 3D printing and additive manufacturing.

I worked on a product for coordinating, scheduling, and billing custom additive manufacturing jobs.

### Some Tech I Learned

##### [Redux](https://redux.js.org) state container for JavaScript apps
Working with Redux taught me how to manage global application state and think critically about data mutations. Plus, who doesn't love to be taught by [Dan Abramov](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux).  

##### [Reselect](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect) selector library for Redux
Caching derived data is cool. But, honestly, I thought memoization was a made up word. I'm still pretty sure it is made up.

##### [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) asset bundler
Do you like debugging large configurations file? Cause I sure don't. Thanks to [SurviveJS](https://survivejs.com/webpack/) for keeping me alive.

##### [Sentry](https://sentry.io) error tracking
I set up the source mapped error tracking on client application. The first time a production error came in with a explicit line reference, I nearly cried I was so happy.

##### [Eslint](https://eslint.org) linting utility for JavaScript and JSX
I launched a large initiative to standardize our client-side application codebase. Suprising no one, if you aren't automating your styleguide, you might as well not have one.

##### [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io) automation server
I wrote my first CI Jenkins script to run our linter on every build. Now, all I live for is those green checkmarks.

##### [Prettier](https://prettier.io) opinionated code formatter
I introduced Prettier to our project to standardize our code style. I can't imagine working on a large project without it. Or a small one.
