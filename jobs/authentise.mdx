Authentise is a tech start up building software for 3D printing and additive manufacturing. 

As a Front-End Engineer, I worked on:

- Architecting application state management with redux
- Working with sales, product management, and engineering leadership to design new features for major customers
- Partnering with backend engineers to design and build REST APIs in Python and Flask
- Working with ops to build a CI pipeline with Webpack, reducing lint errors to zero from over 8,000 and establishing source map error tracking
